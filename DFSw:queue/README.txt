First, create a vector of vectors where each vector in the vector represents a node i based on its index in the vector of vectors. Each vector of vectors contains int values representing other nodes that the node i are connected to. Next, create two vectors, pathLengths and numShortestPaths with size equal to the total number of nodes. Finally, call countPaths with 4 variables - the vector of vectors representation of the graph you wish to traverse, the value of the start node, and pathLengths and numShortestest Paths.
